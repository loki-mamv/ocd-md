        <h1>OCD Medication Options: What the Research Shows</h1>
        <div class="article-meta">February 9, 2026 &middot; 9 min read</div>

        <p>Medication is one of the two evidence-based treatments for obsessive-compulsive disorder, alongside Exposure and Response Prevention (ERP). For many people, medication and ERP work best in combination. For others, medication alone provides meaningful symptom reduction when therapy is not accessible or when symptoms are too severe to engage in exposures without pharmacological support.</p>

        <p>The medication landscape for OCD is narrower than many patients expect. Unlike depression, where dozens of drugs across multiple classes have demonstrated efficacy, OCD responds primarily to one class of medication: drugs that strongly inhibit serotonin reuptake. This has been consistently replicated across decades of research.</p>

        <h2>SSRIs: The First-Line Treatment</h2>

        <p>Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors are the standard first-line medications for OCD. The FDA has approved four SSRIs specifically for OCD treatment: fluoxetine (Prozac), fluvoxamine (Luvox), paroxetine (Paxil), and sertraline (Zoloft). Other SSRIs, including escitalopram (Lexapro) and citalopram (Celexa), are used off-label and have supporting evidence from clinical trials.</p>

        <p>There is no strong evidence that any single SSRI is more effective than another for OCD. The choice among them is typically guided by side effect profile, drug interactions, and individual response. If one SSRI is ineffective after an adequate trial, switching to another is a reasonable next step, because response to individual SSRIs varies unpredictably between patients.</p>

        <p class="source">Source: Skapinakis, P., et al. (2016). "Pharmacological and psychotherapeutic interventions for OCD in adults: a systematic review and network meta-analysis." <a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/S2215-0366(16)30069-4">The Lancet Psychiatry, 3(8)</a>.</p>

        <h2>Dosing: Higher Than You Might Expect</h2>

        <p>One of the most common treatment errors in OCD is underdosing. The doses required for OCD are typically higher than those used for depression. A person with major depression might respond to sertraline at 50 to 100mg per day. OCD commonly requires 150 to 200mg. Fluoxetine for depression is often effective at 20mg; for OCD, doses of 40 to 80mg are standard.</p>

        <p>The reason for this difference is not fully understood, but it appears related to the degree of serotonergic modulation required to affect the cortico-striato-thalamic circuits implicated in OCD. Clinicians unfamiliar with OCD treatment may stop titrating at depression-level doses and incorrectly conclude the medication is not working.</p>

        <p>Onset of action is also slower in OCD than depression. While antidepressant effects may appear within two to four weeks, OCD symptom reduction often takes eight to twelve weeks at adequate doses. Premature discontinuation is a frequent problem. The APA guidelines recommend at least eight to twelve weeks at the maximum tolerated dose before concluding that an SSRI trial has failed.</p>

        <h2>Clomipramine: The Oldest Option</h2>

        <p>Clomipramine (Anafranil) is a tricyclic antidepressant that was the first medication shown to be effective for OCD, predating the SSRIs by years. It remains one of the most potent serotonin reuptake inhibitors available and is sometimes more effective than SSRIs for individual patients. A meta-analysis by Ackerman and Greenland (2002) found that clomipramine produced slightly larger effect sizes than SSRIs in head-to-head comparisons, though this advantage may partly reflect differences in study design.</p>

        <p>Clomipramine is not typically used as a first-line treatment because its side effect burden is heavier than SSRIs. Common side effects include dry mouth, constipation, sedation, weight gain, and sexual dysfunction. More concerning, clomipramine carries a risk of cardiac arrhythmias at high doses and requires ECG monitoring. It is also dangerous in overdose.</p>

        <p>In practice, clomipramine is often reserved for patients who have not responded to two or more adequate SSRI trials. It can also be used as an augmentation strategy at low doses added to an SSRI, though this combination requires careful monitoring due to pharmacokinetic interactions.</p>

        <h2>Augmentation Strategies</h2>

        <p>When SSRIs alone are insufficient, augmentation with a low-dose antipsychotic is the best-studied next step. Risperidone and aripiprazole have the most evidence. A meta-analysis by Dold et al. (2015) in the Journal of Clinical Psychiatry found that antipsychotic augmentation produced a modest but statistically significant benefit in SSRI non-responders, with about one-third of previously treatment-resistant patients showing improvement.</p>

        <p>Antipsychotic augmentation is not without risks. Even at low doses, these medications can cause weight gain, metabolic changes, and in some cases, tardive dyskinesia with long-term use. The decision to augment should be weighed against these risks and is generally reserved for cases where adequate SSRI trials and ERP have not produced sufficient improvement.</p>

        <p>Other augmentation strategies with preliminary evidence include memantine (an NMDA receptor modulator), N-acetylcysteine, and glutamate-targeting agents. These are areas of active research but are not yet considered standard treatment.</p>

        <p class="source">Source: Dold, M., et al. (2015). "Antipsychotic augmentation of serotonin reuptake inhibitors in treatment-resistant OCD." <a href="https://doi.org/10.4088/JCP.14r09618">Journal of Clinical Psychiatry, 76(6)</a>.</p>

        <h2>What Medication Can and Cannot Do</h2>

        <p>SSRIs typically reduce OCD symptoms by 40 to 60% in responders, as measured by the Yale-Brown Obsessive Compulsive Scale. This is clinically significant but rarely constitutes complete remission. Most people who respond to medication still experience some obsessive thoughts and compulsive urges; the difference is that these symptoms become more manageable and less time-consuming.</p>

        <p>Medication does not teach new coping skills. It does not help the person learn to tolerate uncertainty or resist compulsions through practice. This is why the combination of medication and ERP is generally more effective than either alone, particularly for moderate to severe OCD. The medication reduces the baseline level of distress enough that the person can engage productively in exposures.</p>

        <h2>Duration of Treatment</h2>

        <p>There is no consensus on how long medication should be continued after symptoms improve. The APA recommends at least one to two years of maintenance treatment before considering tapering. Relapse rates after medication discontinuation are high, estimated at 50 to 90% in various studies. Tapering should be done slowly, ideally with concurrent ERP to consolidate gains.</p>

        <p>Some patients choose to remain on medication indefinitely, particularly if they have experienced multiple relapses. This is a reasonable decision when the medication is well-tolerated. The long-term safety profile of SSRIs is well-established, and for many people the benefits of continued symptom control outweigh the inconvenience of ongoing medication.</p>

        <h2>Working with Your Prescriber</h2>

        <p>If you are being treated for OCD with medication, make sure your prescriber is aware of the dosing and timeline differences between OCD and depression treatment. Ask whether your current dose is within the OCD therapeutic range. Ask how long to wait before concluding a trial has failed. If your prescriber is not familiar with OCD-specific pharmacotherapy, consider requesting a referral to a psychiatrist with OCD experience. The IOCDF provider directory includes psychiatrists as well as therapists.</p>
